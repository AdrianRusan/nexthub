# Nexthub

Nexthub is a modern web application built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), designed to provide a seamless and efficient user experience. It leverages the power of server-side rendering and static site generation to deliver fast and scalable web pages. Nexthub is ideal for developers looking to create dynamic web applications with minimal setup and configuration.

## Overview

Nexthub serves as a boilerplate for building web applications with a focus on performance and developer experience. It integrates several popular libraries and tools to enhance functionality and streamline development processes. The project is structured to support rapid development and easy deployment, making it suitable for both small and large-scale applications.

## Key Features

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Enhances SEO and performance by rendering pages on the server.
- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Pre-renders pages at build time, offering fast load times and improved scalability.
- **Authentication**: Integrated with Clerk for user authentication and management.
- **UI Components**: Utilizes Radix UI for accessible and customizable components like Dialog, Dropdown Menu, and Toast.
- **Date Handling**: Employs `date-fns` for efficient date manipulation and formatting.
- **Styling**: Uses Tailwind CSS for a utility-first approach to styling, allowing for rapid UI development.
- **Font Optimization**: Automatically optimizes and loads custom Google Fonts using `next/font`.

## Getting Started

To get started with the development server, run one of the following commands:


```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
